# Face Detection Project

This project aims to develop a face detection system using a pipeline consisting of image sourcing, labeling, augmentation, training a new model based on VGG16 using TensorFlow, and running the model locally using the CV library.

## Pipeline Overview

1. *Locally Sourcing Images*: In this step, images are sourced locally using the CV library (OpenCV). The CV library provides functions for reading images from directories or capturing images from connected cameras.


2. *Labeling*: The collected images need to be labeled to identify the regions containing faces. This can be done manually using annotation by LabelMe library or by utilizing pre-existing labeled datasets.


3. *Augmentation*: Augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of the dataset, making the model more robust and generalizable. Common augmentation techniques include rotation, scaling, flipping, and noise addition.


4. *Training*: The labeled and augmented dataset is used to train a new model. In this project, the VGG16 architecture is employed as a base model due to its strong performance in image recognition tasks.


5. *TensorFlow*: TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, is used to build, train, and evaluate the face detection model. The VGG16 model is adapted by adding new layers on top to accommodate the specific requirements of the face detection task.


6. *Running Locally*: The trained model can be deployed locally using the CV library (OpenCV). The CV library provides functions and tools for real-time image and video processing, making it suitable for running the face detection model on local images or live video streams.
